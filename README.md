  <h2>BPMN-JS Integration</h2>
  <h3>View diagrams in filebrowser!</h3>
</p>

> âš  WARNING: **This is a fork of the original filebrowser project (Vue + GO). In this version, all your .bpmn files will open in bpmn-js instead of the standard Text Editor.**

![Preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50220345/68059408-c9c56780-fcd2-11e9-88aa-0fcf4d03c438.gif)

Nowadays, business diagrams follow the universal BPMN standard.

The open-source solution bpmn-js from BPMN.io makes it incredibly easy to view and build such diagrams.

This new filebrowser feature enables the integration with bpmn-js for viewing only.

## Features

Open any .bpmn file to view the diagram (e.g. in the 00_Diagrams_Example folder).

You can click and hold the mouse in order to move the diagram around.

You can also zoom with CTRL + Scroll!

## To do

Add bpmn-js extensions.
